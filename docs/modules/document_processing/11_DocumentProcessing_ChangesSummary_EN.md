# KnowForge Document Comprehensive Processing - Change Summary

## Background

Based on user requirements, we have modified development documents to support document comprehensive processing functionality. This feature will enable KnowForge to automatically identify and process different content types (text, images, tables, formulas) in PDF documents without requiring manual categorization by users.

## Main Changes

### 1. Added Design Documents

- **Document Comprehensive Processing Design** (`docs/others/13_DocumentProcessingDesign.md` and `docs/others/13_DocumentProcessingDesign_EN.md`)
  - Details the background, goals, architecture, and implementation plan for document comprehensive processing
  - Defines four new core modules and their functions and interfaces
  - Proposes technology selection and evaluation metrics

### 2. Modified Roadmap Document (`docs/08_ROADMAP_KnowForge.md` and `docs/08_ROADMAP_KnowForge_EN.md`)

- **Elevated document comprehensive processing to short-term priority**:
  - Implement PDF content comprehensive extraction in v0.1.5
  - Implement table and formula specialized processing in v0.1.6
  - Implement content integration and format preservation in v0.1.7-v0.2.0
- **Adjusted the definition of multimodal capabilities**, more clearly distinguishing between document content comprehensive processing needed in the near term and advanced multimodal capabilities planned for the long term
- **Updated current development status**, adding a description of the next phase's focus

### 3. Updated Iteration Plan Document (`docs/06_ITER_KnowForge.md`)

- **Expanded Iteration 4 work content**, adding document comprehensive processing related tasks
- **Added relevant risk items**, including complex layout processing, table and formula recognition challenges
- **Updated technical verification requirements**, adding PDF structure analysis, table recognition, and other technical verification points

### 4. Enhanced Detailed Design Document (`docs/02_LLD_KnowForge.md`)

- **Added detailed design for four new modules**:
  1. DocumentAnalyzer: Document Structure Analyzer
  2. ContentExtractor: Content Extractor
  3. ContentProcessor: Content Processor
  4. ContentIntegrator: Content Integrator
- **Updated InputHandler module**, adding complex document processing capability
- **Updated Processor flow controller**, integrating the new document processing flow
- **Renumbered all modules** to ensure consistency

### 5. Updated README.md and README_EN.md

- **Added next steps plan description**, clarifying the development direction for document comprehensive processing
- **Added links to new design documents** for easy access

## Implementation Schedule

| Version | Functionality | Planned Completion Time |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------|
| v0.1.5 | PDF Content Comprehensive Extraction | 2-3 weeks |
| v0.1.6 | Table and Formula Specialized Processing | 2-3 weeks |
| v0.1.7-v0.2.0 | Content Integration and Format Preservation | 3-4 weeks |

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

1. **Complex Layout Recognition**: Use PyMuPDF combined with custom algorithms for page layout analysis, incorporating deep learning models when necessary
2. **Table Recognition and Processing**: Use specialized table extraction libraries (Camelot/tabula-py) combined with LLM understanding
3. **Formula Recognition and Conversion**: Use specialized formula OCR tools combined with LaTeX format conversion
4. **Maintaining Original Document Structure**: Design ContentIntegrator to reconstruct document structure based on original order and position

## Latest Document Updates

- Updated the **Document Processing Implementation Plan** (`docs/modules/document_processing/12_DocumentProcessing_Implementation.md`)
  - Updated current development status, all features planned for v0.1.5 and v0.1.6 have been fully implemented
  - Added recommendations for future development and planning for v0.1.7
  - Provided detailed implementation locations and core feature summary

## Current Completion Status

- ✅ All core functionalities of document comprehensive processing have been implemented
- ✅ Document analysis and content extraction features (v0.1.5) are fully implemented
- ✅ Table and formula specialized processing (v0.1.6) are fully implemented
- ✅ Content integration and format preservation features have been implemented ahead of schedule

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete detailed technical solution design
2. ✅ Conduct necessary technical verification
3. ✅ Develop module functionalities according to plan
4. ✅ Write test cases and ensure functionality correctness
5. ⏩ Create user guides explaining how to use the new functionalities
6. ⏩ Proceed with v0.1.7 feature planning and development
