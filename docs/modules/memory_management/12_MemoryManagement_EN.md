# Advanced Knowledge Memory Management System Design

## 1. Background and Objectives

As the amount of knowledge processed by the KnowForge project continues to grow, simple knowledge storage methods are no longer sufficient to meet the needs of efficient retrieval and semantic understanding. Additionally, knowledge aging, priority management, and forgetting mechanisms during long-term use have also become issues that must be addressed. This document aims to design a more advanced knowledge memory management system that mimics how the human brain handles memory, improving knowledge storage efficiency and retrieval accuracy.

## 2. System Architecture
