## Current Development Stage Overview

The KnowForge project is currently in the early development stage (0.1.2), with the basic architecture established and part of the core functionalities implemented. The major work completed so far includes:

1. **Basic Architecture Setup** (0.1.0):
   - Core module structure design and implementation
   - Multilingual support system
   - Basic configuration management
   - Multi-source input processing (PDF, web links, code files)
   - Command-line interface

2. **Logging System Upgrade** (0.1.1):
   - Integration of Logloom logging system
   - Implementation of internationalized log messages
   - Addition of log file rotation functionality

3. **Vector Memory Management Optimization** (0.1.2):
   - ChromaDB API compatibility fixes
   - Enhanced hybrid retrieval strategies
   - Optimized threshold handling logic
   - Improved keyword matching functionality

## Development Priorities

### 1. Short-term Goals (0.1.3 - 0.1.5)

#### 1.1 Input Processing Enhancement
- **Image OCR Capability Strengthening**: While basic input types are already supported, the OCR functionality needs further enhancement
  - Implement multilingual OCR support (Chinese, English, formula recognition)
  - Add image preprocessing (denoising, contrast enhancement) to improve OCR accuracy
  - Develop image analysis capability to recognize charts, tables, and flowcharts

#### 1.2 LLM Calling Module Reinforcement
- **DeepSeek Model Call Optimization**:
  - Add more model options (DeepSeek Chat/Reasoner)
  - Optimize prompt templates to improve generation quality
  - Implement context manager to avoid excessively long inputs
  - Add dynamic adjustment functionality for model parameters (e.g., temperature)

#### 1.3 Output Format Extension
- **Enriched Output Capabilities**:
  - Improve PDF generation (currently only basic support)
  - Optimize Jupyter Notebook output format
  - Add HTML output option
  - Support code block syntax highlighting

#### 1.4 Test Coverage Enhancement
- **Expand Test Coverage**:
  - Add unit tests for new features
  - Add mock tests for LLM calls
  - Develop end-to-end test cases
  - Implement automated testing workflow

### 2. Mid-term Goals (0.2.0 - 0.3.0)

#### 2.1 Advanced Memory Management Features
- **Memory Library Management Enhancement**:
  - Implement memory expiration management
  - Add memory priority sorting
  - Develop memory categorization tag system
  - Support memory library query and browsing interface

#### 2.2 User Interface Development
- **Add Graphical Interface**:
  - Develop Web-based user interface (e.g., using Flask or Streamlit)
  - Design intuitive operation workflows
  - Add real-time processing progress display
  - Provide result preview functionality

#### 2.3 Plugin System Design
- **Implement Extensible Plugin Architecture**:
  - Design unified plugin interfaces
  - Support custom input source plugins
  - Support custom output format plugins
  - Implement model provider plugins (supporting more LLMs)

#### 2.4 MoeAI-C System Integration
- **Interface with MoeAI-C System**:
  - Implement standard API interface
  - Support remote calling
  - Implement data synchronization mechanism
  - Design secure authentication process

### 3. Long-term Goals (0.4.0+)

#### 3.1 Multimodal Support
- **Extend Multimodal Capabilities**:
  - Add audio input processing
  - Support video content extraction and analysis
  - Implement mixed understanding of images and text
  - Support multimodal output (including chart generation)

#### 3.2 Collaborative Workflow
- **Support Multi-user Collaboration**:
  - Develop user permission management
  - Implement shared memory library
  - Support collaborative note editing
  - Add annotation and feedback mechanism

#### 3.3 Offline Mode and Performance Optimization
- **Enhance Offline Capabilities**:
  - Support local small models
  - Optimize vector database performance
  - Implement incremental processing mechanism
  - Reduce resource consumption

## Development Recommendations and Best Practices

### Code Organization and Style
1. **Follow the established modular structure**, maintaining high cohesion and low coupling
2. **Improve documentation**, adding detailed comments and design documents for each new feature
3. **Maintain internationalization support**, manage all user-visible text with LocaleManager
4. **Standardize error handling**, using custom exception classes (NoteGenError and subclasses)

### Testing Strategy
1. **Write unit tests**, ensuring test coverage for each new feature
2. **Use mock objects**, simulating external dependencies (such as LLM API)
3. **Run integration tests regularly**, verifying overall system functionality
4. **Create regression tests for discovered bugs**, preventing recurrence

### Version Control and Release
1. **Follow semantic versioning** (SemVer):
   - Minor versions (0.1.x) for bug fixes and small feature enhancements
   - Medium versions (0.x.0) for new functional modules
   - Major versions (x.0.0) for significant architectural changes
2. **Maintain CHANGELOG**, recording detailed changes for each version
3. **Regular releases**, maintaining small update steps for easier testing and feedback

## Next Step Action Plan

### Immediate Tasks (Priority from high to low)
1. **Implement Image OCR Functionality**
   - Integrate easyocr library, supporting Chinese and English recognition
   - Add image preprocessing functionality
   - Write test cases

2. **Optimize LLM Call Logic**
   - Enhance prompt engineering to improve generation quality
   - Implement dynamic context window management
   - Add more model option configurations

3. **Improve PDF Output Functionality**
   - Implement conversion from Markdown to PDF
   - Add table of contents generation
   - Support custom styling

4. **Develop Basic Web Interface**
   - Design simple user interaction flow
   - Implement file upload and result display
   - Add basic progress display functionality

### Technical Debt Management
1. **Refactor the memory_manager module** to further optimize code organization
2. **Optimize vector retrieval performance**, especially for large memory libraries
3. **Improve test coverage**, particularly for recently modified parts

## Conclusion

The KnowForge project has established a solid foundational architecture and implemented early versions of core functionalities. Through continuous iteration and module enhancement, the project is moving toward becoming a full-featured AI-assisted learning note generator. Current priorities include enhancing input processing capabilities, optimizing the LLM calling module, expanding output format options, and improving test coverage.

Future development should maintain modular design, following established code organization and internationalization support principles, while continuously improving documentation and testing. Progress should be made according to feature priorities, maintaining small update steps to facilitate timely feedback and adjustments.
